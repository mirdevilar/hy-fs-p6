## Notes (please ignore if I forgot to remove this)

# 6a. Flux architecture and Redux
- Pure functions are such, that they do not cause any side effects and they must always return the same response when called with the same parameters.
- npm install --save-dev jest @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react eslint-plugin-jest

# 6b. Redux toolkit:
- install library @reduxjs/toolkit
- configureStore()
- investigate error: "Selector unknown returned a different result when called with the same parameters. This can lead to unnecessary rerenders.
Selectors that return a new reference (such as an object or an array) should be memoized: https://redux.js.org/usage/deriving-data-selectors#optimizing-selectors-with-memoization "

# Before submitting
- run eslint
